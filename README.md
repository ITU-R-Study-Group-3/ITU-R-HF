## ITURHFProp(), P533(), P372(), and ITURNoise()

Software methods for the prediction of the performance of HF circuits based on 
Recommendations ITU-R P.533-14 and P.372-15

***

## P533()

This program, presented as a dynamic linked library, provides methods for the prediction of available frequencies, signal levels, and the predicted reliability for analogue and digital-modulated HF systems, taking into account not only the signal-to-noise ratio but also the expected time and frequency spreads of the channel. This program calculates the HF path parameters that appear in Recommendation ITU-R P.533-14. 

Great care has been taken in this implementation to follow the ITU published standard P.533-14. The flow of this implementation was designed primarily for readability and clarity, with performance being the secondary goal. It is hoped that this code will illuminate the standard and be easily maintainable.  For the definition of the interface to this library, please see
below.

## P372()

This program, presented as a dynamic linked library, provides methods for the prediction of background levels of radio-frequency noise in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 GHz in accordance with Recommendation ITU-R P.372-14. The program takes into account noise from the atmosphere, galaxy, and man-made sources. The program is used by the program P533() as part of the required calculations.

## ITURHFProp()

This program's sole purpose is to act as an input and output data wrapper for P533(). This routine is as an example of how the P533() model can be used in other applications. Please refer to ITUHFProp() to determine how data is loaded and unloaded from P533() to conduct successfully HF circuit analysis.

### RPT_DUMPPATH

A Special report type called `RPT_DUMPPATH` can be used as OPTION1 with no
other OPTIONS selected. The OPTION, `RPT_DUMPPATH`, typically is used for
trouble shooting and for detailed analysis that may be required for point-to-
point links. This option generates a large amount of data.

`RPT_DUMPPATH` outputs most of the calculated values. Note the output from
this option is path length dependent. Note for links that are > 9000 km the
output printed by the OPTION, `RPT_DUMPPATH`, only applies to a small number
of the control and penetration points necessary to do the prediction.

The file created by the option is named **PDDddmmyy-hhnnss.txt** where the path data dump file is time stamped:

```
dd = day
mm = month
yy = year
hh = hour
nn = minute
ss = seconds
```

Examples of RptFileFormat settings.

```
RptFileFormat "RPT_E | RPT_PR | RPT_RXLOCATION | RPT_D | RPT_GRW"
RptFileFormat "RPT_DUMPPATH"
```

There are two ways to indicate the analysis area of the calculation

**Method One:** For the output geographical area to be examined all four corners of the analysis are must be specified. For point-to-point links all four corner coordinates are identical. The convention
for these coordinates is up is north and left is west.

```
LL.lat    Lower left latitude, decimal degrees, -90.0 to 90.0
LL.lng    Lower left longitude, decimal degrees, -180.0 to 180.0
LR.lat    Lower right latitude, decimal degrees, -90.0 to 90.0
LR.lng    Lower right longitude, decimal degrees, -180.0 to 180.0
UL.lat    Upper left latitude, decimal degrees, -90.0 to 90.0
UL.lng    Upper left longitude, decimal degrees, -180.0 to 180.0
UR.lat    Upper right latitude, decimal degrees, -90.0 to 90.0
UR.lng    Upper right longitude, decimal degrees, -180.0 to 180.0
```

**Method Two:** The analysis area is entered as two points of a rectangle by entering latitude and longitude of the South East and North West corners of the analysis rectangle

```
SE.lat    South East latitude, decimal degrees, -90.0 to 90.0
SE.lng    South East longitude, decimal degrees, -180.0 to 180.0
NW.lat    North West latitude, decimal degrees, -90.0 to 90.0
NW.lng    North West longitude, decimal degrees, -180.0 to 180.0
```

Latitude and Longitude increment step. Note: There are no lower increment limits. These input are only
relevant to areas and will be ignored for point-to-point calculations as defined by the bounding
area above.

```
latinc    Latitude increment step in decimal degrees, > 0.0
lnginc    Longitude increment step in decimal degrees, > 0.0
```

### A brief description of the interface to P533.dll:

The program P533.dll has the following entry points:

```c
DLLEXPORT int P533(struct PathData *path)
DLLEXPORT const char * P533Version();
DLLEXPORT void GreatCirclePoint(struct Location here, struct Location there, struct ControlPt *midpnt, double distance, double fraction);
DLLEXPORT double GreatCircleDistance(struct Location here, struct Location there);
DLLEXPORT void GeomagneticCoords(struct Location here, struct Location *there);
DLLEXPORT double Bearing(struct Location here, struct Location there);
DLLEXPORT int AllocatePathMemory(struct PathData *path);
DLLEXPORT int FreePathMemory(struct PathData *path);
DLLEXPORT int InputDump(struct PathData *path);
```

An external program is necessary to run the P533.dll engine. An external program must create, manage
and then free the data memory interface to P533.dll. An external program is used to populate the
structure PathData, which is defined in p533.h. It is the responsibility of an external program to
insure that the user input data and static data arrays are loaded correctly. The P533.dll does limited I/O. P533.dll contains “helper” subroutines to read the F2 layer variability file “P1239-3 Decile Factors.txt” via ReadP1239() and user selected antenna files via ReadType13().
The P533.dll does validate the input data. The data validation in P533.dll insures that the user is
requesting calculations within the designed range of input parameters to the P.533-14 method.

The program ITURHFProp is an example of how an external program can set up and run the data necessary
for P533.dll calculations. It is suggest that those who have an interest in creating a management
program for custom P533.dll applications obtain a copy of the source for ITURHFProp from the ITU.

In addition to the user desired input parameters an external program must manage the following data
sets. The four sources of external data that are necessary to set up the structure PathData and
run P533()are:

1. **Ionospheric data or maps**.
This data is in the ~/IonMap directory which contains monthly median foF2 and M(3000)F2 data
at 1.5-degree latitude and longitude increments for low and high sunspot numbers. The data in
these files was generated by the methods in REC533(). The method to derive these maps is
derived from arrays of spherical harmonic coefficients, see Equation (3) of Recommendation
ITU-R P.1239-3. The coefficients in this form do not allow for contemporary data to be
incorporated into the maps easily. For this reason the ITU has freed this data in the form of
a map that can be updated.

2. **MUF variability**.
The file "P1239-2 Decile Factors.txt" is read in to get the decile factors related to MUF
variability. This data can been examined in Recommendation ITU-R P.1239-3

3. **Antenna data**.
The PathData structure requires the antenna pattern for the transmitter and receiver, in all
cases except when isotropic is chosen. At present this pattern is 360 degrees azimuth and 91
degrees elevation. This data typically can be found from NEC or Type 13 antenna data from the
VOACAP suite.

Typically as long as the month does not change, the input data arrays from the three sources need not
be changed. Only when the month changes during an analysis does any external data need to be read in
again by the external program. For instance, in the event that an analysis is run which straddles two
or more months, i) the ionospheric maps, and ii) the noise data, will need to be reloaded. 
In addition to main entry point into the P533.dll, P533(), the following programs can be used to
interface and troubleshoot the operations of an external management program. Please note the structure
definitions that appear in the following utility functions are defined in P533.h.

```c
DLLEXPORT const char * P533Version();
```

The program P533Version() takes no arguments and returns the version of P533.dll as string variable.

```c
DLLEXPORT void GreatCirclePoint(struct Location here, struct Location there, struct ControlPt *midpnt,
                                double distance, double fraction);
```

The program GreatCirclePoint() is a utility program that returns a point along the great circle path
between the Locations, here and there, at a fraction of the distance from here. Note the midpoint of
the path is included for circumstances where the path takes the long way round the Earth.

```c
DLLEXPORT double GreatCircleDistance(struct Location here, struct Location there);
```

The program GreatCircleDistance() determines the great circle distance from the Location here to the
Location there.

```c
DLLEXPORT void GeomagneticCoords(struct Location here, struct Location *there);
```

The Location here is converted to geomagnetic coordinates and returned as Location pointed to by
there.

```c
DLLEXPORT double Bearing(struct Location here, struct Location there);
```

The program Bearing() returns the radian bearing from the Location here to Location there.

```c
DLLEXPORT int AllocatePathMemory(struct PathData *path);
```

The program AllocatePathMemory() is designed to be used in external programs to allocate the structure
PathData. This program is used to create the data interface to P533.dll and returns a pointer to the
data structure. While this routine creates the data interface the program FreePathMemory() releases
the memory.

```c
DLLEXPORT int FreePathMemory(struct PathData *path);
```

The program FreePathMemory() is designed to release the memory that was created by
AllocatePathMemory().

```c
DLLEXPORT int InputDump(struct PathData *path);
```

The program InputDump() is a utility to print the contents of the path structure. This utility is
useful to determine that the path structure has been passed correctly to the P533.dll. All of the user
input data is printed as are the extremes of the data arrays.

The data that is required to be loaded into the structure PathData is in the sections “User-provided
Input” and “Array pointers” below. The section “Calculated Parameters” contains the parameters that
are returned by the calculations in subroutine P533(). A management program that runs P533.dll will
have access to all of these parameters. Please refer to ITURHFProp to see an example of how the
PathData structure can be interrogated to remove calculation results.

```c

In the above some of the uppercase words are C defines that represent numbers and are used in the code
as an alias for readability.

### A brief description of the interface to P372.dll:

The program P372.dll has the following entry points:

```c
// Prototypes
DLLEXPORT int AllocateNoiseMemory(struct NoiseParams *noiseP);
DLLEXPORT int FreeNoiseMemory(struct NoiseParams *noiseP);
DLLEXPORT int Noise(struct NoiseParams *noiseP, int hour, double lng, double lat, double frequency);
DLLEXPORT int ReadFamDud(struct NoiseParams *noiseP, const char *DataFilePath, int month);
DLLEXPORT void InitializeNoise(struct NoiseParams *noiseP);
DLLEXPORT char const * P372CompileTime();
DLLEXPORT char const * P372Version();
```

An external program is necessary to run the P372.dll engine. An external program must create, manage
and then free the data memory interface to P372.dll. An external program is used to populate the
structure NoiseParams, which is defined in noise.h. It is the responsibility of an external program to
insure that the user input data and static data arrays are loaded correctly. The P372.dll does limited I/O. P372.dll contains subroutines to read the ITU harmonized coefficient files. The files required are part of this package and are named COEFFXX.TXT, where XX is a two-digit number for the month. P372.dll uses the month dependent noise coefficient values for the fakp[][], fakabp[][], dud[][][] and fam[][] used in the calculation of atmospheric noise. 

The atmospheric noise data arises from the mixed coefficient files, COEFFXX.TXT, that were compiled by Dambolt and Suessman. These files contain the original spherical harmonic coefficients for foF2 and M(3000)F2 in addition to data related to atmospheric noise, layer thickness, MUF statistics, etc. for a particular month. Some of this data appears to be deprecated. 

Although P372.dll is called from P533.dll it can be executed independently if its data structures are loaded correctly for the calculation. 

```c
// Struct Definitions

struct FamStats {
	int tmblk;          // Timeblock
	double FA;          // Atmospheric noise in dB above kT0b at 1 MHz
	double SigmaFam;    // Standard deviation of values, Fam
	double Du;          // Ratio of upper decile to median value, Fam
	double SigmaDu;     // Standard deviations of values of Du
	double Dl;          // Ratio of median value, Fam, to lower decile
	double SigmaDl;     // Standard deviation of values of Dl
};

struct NoiseParams {
	// Output Parameters
	double FaA;  // Atmospheric noise
	double DuA;  // Atmospheric noise upper decile
	double DlA;  // Atmospheric noise lower decile
	double FaM;  // Man-made noise
	double DuM;  // Man-made noise upper decile
	double DlM;  // Man-made noise lower decile
	double FaG;  // Galactic noise
	double DuG;  // Galactic noise upper decile
	double DlG;  // Galactic noise lower decile
	double DuT;  // Total noise upper decile
	double DlT;  // Total noise lower decile
	double FamT; // Total noise

	// Non-Output Parameters
	double ManMadeNoise;
	double ***fakp;
	double **fakabp;
	double **fam;
	double ***dud;
};
```

### Return Codes ITURHFProp,P533 and P372

When running ITURHFProp the typical return code is 1000. This indicates that the program has executed
correctly. In the event that an error occurs the program will exit with one of the following error
numbers. The following list may be useful to determine the type of error. Please note that in the event
that the calculation by P533() fails ITURHFProp() will exit with the appropriate P533() error.

```

For additional details please see noise.h in the ITU-R-HF repo. 


### ITURNoise.exe
The program ITURNoise.exe is a utility program that has two modes: 

- Mode 1 which returns the combined total noise, total noise upper decile, 
    and total noise lower decile., and the constituent parts of the total noise: 
    galactic, atmospheric, and man-made noise calculation or

- Mode 2 generates the data necessary to create Recommendation P.372-14 Figures 13 through 36: a), b), and c)

### Mode 1 – Noise Calculation for a Single Location
To return the noise parameters for a single location, Mode 1 above, 7 command line arguments are required. Below is an example of running ITURNoise.exe to return noise for a single location

```
C:\>ITURNoise 1 14 1.0 40.0 165.0 0 "G:\User\Data\" 0
```

- Argument 1 is an integer that indicates the month (1 to 12) of interest. In the example above the desired month is January. 
- Argument 2 is an integer that indicates the hour (1 to 24) UTC at the receive point. In most cases this will require the calculation of the time UTC from the longitude at that receive point. In the example above the receive point is 11 hours (165? E/(15?/hr) ahead of UTC so to determine the noise for the 12th local time hour the 1st hour UTC is chosen. 
- Argument 3 is a float that indicates the frequency (MHz). In the example above the frequency is 1.0 MHz. 
- Argument 4 is a float that indicates the latitude (degrees). In the example above the latitude desired is 40? N. 
- Argument 5 is a float that indicates the longitude (degrees). In the example above the longitude desired is 165? E
- Argument 6 is a float that indicates the man-made noise which can either be categorical (0-5) or value of man-made noise in dB (represented by a negative number). In the example above the value 1.0 indicates that the noise category residential. The category codes appear below. 

    |code|Noise Category|
    |----|--------------|
    | 0.0    | City|
    | 1.0    | Residential|
    | 2.0    | Rural|
    | 3.0    | Quiet Rural|
    | 4.0    | Noisy|
    | 5.0    | Quiet|

- If argument 6 is give as a negative number, the man-made noise will be set to that value where the galactic and atmospheric noise calculations are not performed. This second mode is of little value for this stand-alone program, ITURNoise.exe, running, P533.dll. Overriding the P372 calculation is included here and is consistent with some analyses desired in ITURHFProp which also uses the P372.dll. 
- Argument 7 indicates the location of the required CCIR data files. The data file path must be given as a string enclosed in double quotes without trailing back slash. In the example above the location of the required CCIR data files are on drive C: in the directory Data, “C:\Data”
- Argument 8 allows the program to provide return data from the P.372 calculation is several formats. The table below gibes the integer print flag codes. 

    |code|        Print Mode|
    |----|----------------|
    ||No argument    Prints detailed output to stdout
    |0        |No output|
    |1        |Prints detailed outpuit to stderr|
    |2        |Prints detailed output to file “MakeNoiseOut.txt”|
    |3        | Prints detailed header, column description, and CSV output to stdout|
    |4        |Prints CSV output to stdout|

### Mode 2 – Generate Atmospheric Noise Figure Data Output
There is one command line argument required for Mode 2, the data file path in quotes without the trailing back slash (Please see the description of Mode1 Argument 6 above). 

The following example would generate the figure data in the root directory.

```
C:\>ITURNoise "G:\User\Data"
```

Mode 2 creates the following directory structure in the current directory or directory where it is run.

.\ ----- P372_figures --|-- a ----- csv
                        |
                        |-- b ----- csv
                        | 
                        |-- c ----- csv
```

There are 72 figure data files that are created, 24 per category a), b), and c). The naming convention for the output files follow x_ymzh.csv, where x is the figure data type (a, b, or c), y is the month (1, 4, 7, or 10), and h is the local time hour (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20).


### MakeP372figs.py

MakeP372figs.py was developed for Python 3.7.7 and is dependent on the Python libraries os, glob, numpy, cartopy, matplotlib, math, and pandas. At present MakeP372figs.py only runs on Windows. 

#### Generation of the Recommendation P.372-14 Figure files

The data files, and P372_figures directory structure, are required as input for the Python program MakeP372figs.py. When the program MakeP372figs.py is run from a directory, that immediately contains the directory structure P372_figures above, the following output directories will be created 

```
.\ ----- P372_figures --|-- a --|-- svg
                        |       |-- png
                        |       |-- pdf
                        |
                        |-- b --|-- svg
                        |       |-- png
                        |       |-- pdf
                        |
                        |-- c --|-- svg
                                |-- png
                                |-- pdf
```

MakeP372figs.py writes each figure in three common formats: scalable vector graphics (SVG), portable networks graphics (PNG), and portable document format (PDF). The later two are produced at 300 dpi.

Note that the P.372-14 13-36 a) Figures are labeled relative season in the northern hemisphere. The figures generated from MakeP372figs.py are now labeled with the central month of the relative northern hemisphere season. 

|N. Hemisphere Season (P.372-14 Figures)|Months|
|---------------------------------------|------|
| Winter |DEC-JAN-FEB|
| Spring |MAR-APR-MAY|
| Summer |JUN-JUL-AUG|
| Autumn |SEP-OCT-NOV|

Specifically, the a) figure data generated by ITUNoise() in Mode 2 are January, April, July, and October. 

Also note the a) Figures created by MakeP372figs.py have longitude range from 180 degrees west longitude to 180 degrees east longitude instead of the current a) Figure range from 60 degrees west longitude to 60 degrees east longitude. 

The b) and c) Figures are very similar to the published figures in P.372-14 with the exception that the new c) Figures no longer include V_dm, “Expected value of median deviation of average voltage.” 


### Version 14 Notes:

#### Version 14.3

Most of the corrections in this release concern ITURNoise, P372.dll and the python file MakeP372Figs. 

- Compiled on Visual Studio 2022
- ITURNoise project was moved to the Combined.sln file
- Corrections to ITURNoise driver and MakeP372Figs.py
    - The figures that are created by MakeP372Figs are in section 5 of P.372-14. The main reoutine to generate the atmospheric noise from the CCIR coefficent file had an error that was pointed out by Harvey Berger. Thanks Harvey!
    - The time blocks were not used correctly in AtmosphericNoises.c
- Corrected ITUNoise Driver outputting SigmaDU twice to csv for the figures.
- Added V_d and sigma_V_d in Atmospheric noise routine
- Now included x64 output DLL and EXE files.
- Corrections to Linux build
- Fixed Issue #17 reported by lzhengp1986

#### Version 14.1 and 14.2

Efforts since the last release include numerous editorial changes, simplifications, reorganizations, modifications and corrections to memory management, and general bug fixes which are important but do not affect the operation of the calculations. The release notes below contain a summary of those changes which may effect the usefulness of the program and/or the operational work flow of analyses that use ITURHFProp (and its constituent subroutines). 

Special WP 3L thanks to Mr. James Watson for the extraordinary work to make ITURHFProp more useful in general, work to make sure that Linux users of ITURHFProp maintain access, and continued efforts to assure that the program astutely and accurately manages HF antenna patterns. In that regard significant changes were made to streamline the program for the Linux environment while maintaining consistency between Windows and Linux. Much work has been included to make ITURHFProp more easily adapted to both legacy and NEC based antenna patterns. The input of the analysis area has been simplified to be defined by just the South East and North West corners. Equivalence of ARBITRARY and MANUAL for user antenna bearing selection. And most significantly the rearchitecture of ITURHFProp so that the P372 noise calculation can stand alone. Thus noise method going forward after this release can be an independent calculation. 

An abbreviated summary of Changes since the last revision

- Edited Rec P.533-14 Eqn (9) and (10) now F_prob range 0 < F_prob <= 1
- Changed default SNRXX to 99
- Fixed a typo in the P1239 file. '132.' should be '1.32'.
- Added the -c and -t options to the help message.
- Fixed bug with a misplaced return statement that was causing failures when using isotropic antennas.
- Applied the max gain value figure to the Type 14 antennas as well. In most cases this won't be required as it tends to be 0.0.
- Added the Max gain value to the relative gains to make the const17 type of antenna work properly.
- Added a note about the csv option to the man page.
- Added link to RFC4180.
- Added supports for type 11 antennas and checks the antenna type by opening the file and passing a file pointer before calling the appropriate file parser.
- Added Antenna Type 14 Support
- Modified the transmit antenna to accept the n14/N14 names.
- Updated to reflect the use of N14/n14 to denote type 14 antennas.
- Changed Type 14 Antenna File Extension to .n14/.N14
NEC2 uses the file extension 'N14' to denote type 14 antennas. It seems best to use this existing (albeit informal) standard than to try and impose a new standard on users.
- Read the frequency from the file instead of the loop counter as this may be better if we start to handle files that don't comprise 30 ordered frequency blocks.
- Used the variable freqn when calling AllocateAntennaMemory() as this may be clearer.
- Now accepts Upper and Lower Case Suffixes
- Type 14 antennas may be called up with either t14 or T14 file suffixes.
- Changed Antenna.numFreqs to Antenna.freqn to align better with existing variable names.
- Removed the redundant 'bearing' arg from the ReadType14() call.
- Removed a number of debug print statements that we added to assist debugging Type 14 antennas.
- Added support for multiple frequency patterns and type 14 antennas.
- Removed the relative filepath spec from the libp372 so that we load it from the lib dir.
- Added install-data target to copy the data files to /usr/local/share/p533/data.
- Rebase the new architecture for ITURHFProp.
- The noise method P.372 is now independently callable from ITURHFProp.
- AntennaGain() and AntennaGain08() require a direction to determine the bearing. Although for an isotropic rx/tx antenna this is irrelevant when using a real antenna pattern the direction must be used to determine the gain. For both programs the direction has now been included as an input
- Corrected wrap around error of the bearing in AntennaGain()
- When a T13 antenna file is read there is an \n at the end of the line that adds a line feed to the output. Removed
- Added UNDOCUMENTED option "-t" to the command line to suppress all output save the CSV table
- Corrected missing trailer from one line analysis output.
- Fixed Antenna file input problem
