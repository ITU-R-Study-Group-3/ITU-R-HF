		P533()
			This program provides methods for the prediction of available frequencies, signal levels, and the predicted reliability
			for analogue and digital-modulated HF systems, taking into account not only the signal-to-noise ratio but also the expected
			time and frequency spreads of the channel. This program calculates the HF path parameters that appear in ITU-R P.533-12.
			This program is loosely based on the program REC533. This model uses control points to determine the modes of propagation of
			HF signals in the ionosphere.

			Great care has been taken in this implementation to follow the ITU published standard P.533-12. The flow of this implementation
			was designed primarily for readability and clarity, with performance being the secondary goal. Unfortunately, clever performance-enhancing
			algorithms tend to obscure many calculations. It is hoped that this code will illuminate the standard and be easily maintainable.

			Where possible, this code has been verified with the original REC533() code. There are inevitable variations between REC533 and this
			implementation, not only because of improvements to computer resources in the five decades since REC533's inception but also because of the
			differences between FORTRAN and C. It has become apparent over the course of this project that there were unfortunate omissions and additions
			to the REC533() code that were at odds with the standard. These variations and algorithmic eccentricities have been discussed at length with
			ITU Study Group 3, in particular Working Party 3L. Many individuals who worked on the creation of the original REC533 implementation are no
			longer accessible, which is another reason to document this effort as thoroughly as possible. It would be a shame if decades of hard work were
			lost to esoteric coding techniques that obfuscate the model's inner workings. The original REC533() code used exceptionally clever methods;
			however, those methods often clouded the possible understanding of the actual calculation.

			Use of variable names in the standard should make the algorithms more readable, albeit at the potential expense of having multiply defined
			identical variables in subroutines. There may be occasional redundant calculations again for clarity. In addition, for clarity,some of the calculations
			may use pedantic methods that may be obvious inefficient. This is in an attempt to make the code more accessible to those who are unfamiliar with
			it. Communication is the first priority of this effort; efficiency is secondary.

			The P533() routine has been designed to operate on the data structure path whose prototype can be found in P533.h as the data structure PathData.
			Please start with this header file when exploring this implementation. The structure PathData was determined as the most efficient way to pass data
			between the subroutines without losing clarity. Take note that the #defines in this header file are primarily there to enhance readability. That is
			why there are several #defines that resolve to identical values.

			The P533() routine is designed to do no I/O. It simply takes the structure PathData path and calculates. This was done to enhance usability and
			portability. It has become clear over years of using legacy propagation models that this is the most rational and expedient architecture. The data
			must be loaded into the structure PathData elsewhere before P533() can run. A rudimentary implementation/example of how to use this propagation model
			will accompany P533(). The application ITURHFProp() sets up the data necessary to operate the core P533(). It is hoped that the program ITURHFProp() will
			be used in many situations where rudimentary analyses are satisfactory.

			It is the intent of this project that users will be able to freely use the model with public domain compilers and tools. Please refer to ITURHFProp()
			for details on how to populate the structure PathData. The following outlines the main data sets that must be loaded for the proper operation of P533().
			There are four sources of external data that are necessary to set up the structure PathData and run p533(), not including user input.

				i) Ionospheric data or maps. This data is in the ~/IonMap directory which contains monthly median foF2and M(3000)F2 data at 1.5-degree latitude and
				longitude increments for low and high sunspot numbers. The subroutine ReadIonParameters() reads these map files. The data in these files was generated
				by the methods in REC533(). Prior to this implementation, the data in these files only existed internally to REC533(). The method to derive these maps
				is derived from arrays of spherical harmonic coefficients, see Equation (3) P.1239-2. The coefficients in this form do not allow for contemporary data
				to be incorporated into the maps easily. For this reason the ITU has freed this data in the form of a map that can be updated.

				ii) Atmospheric data. Mixed coefficient files that were compiled by Dambolt and Suessman. These files contain the original spherical harmonic coefficients
				for foF2 and M(3000)F2 in addition to other data related to atmospheric noise, layer thickness, MUF statistics, etc. for a particular month. Some  of this
				data appears to be deprecated. For instance, much of the foE data has been replaced by the method found in Section 4 of ITU-R P.1239-2. In this
				implementation only the atmospheric data will be used. The suplemental subroutine ReadCoeff() can be used to examine these coefficients in more detail.
				Much of the detail about the arrays found in these coefficient files will be available in REC533() code. Refer to the file ReadCoeffExample() for an example
				how to use these coefficient files in an external application.

				iii) MUF variability. The file "P1239-2 Decile Factors.txt" is read in to get the decile factors related to MUF variability. This file is read in by using
				the subroutine ReadP1239(path);

				iv) Antenna data. The PathData structure requires the antenna pattern for the transmitter and receiver. At preset this pattern is 360 degrees azimuth
				and 91 degrees elevation. This data typically can be found from NEC or Type 13 antenna data from the VOACAP suite.

				An external program is necessary to run the p533() engine. The external program must populate the path structure with the correct data. The program ValidatePath()
				initially does input parameter validity checking. The p533() does no I/O. All input data to p533() is handled by higher level programs. By design, the path
				structure that p533() uses for calculation can be externally altered for whichever study the user desires. As long as the month does not change, the data arrays
				from the three sources above need not be changed. Only when the month changes during an analysis does any external data need to be read in again. For instance,
				in the event that an analysis is run which straddles two or more months, i) the ionoshpheric maps, and ii) the atmospheric data, will need to be reloaded.
				The MUF variability data, iii), are for an entire year.
